# Character_auto_Replacement

The program is written in python which detects all non-ASCII characters in .srt files (usually subtitle files for movies) and replaces them whit ASCII characters.

  For example:
    'Đ' -> 'Dj'
    'ð' -> 'dj'
    'æ' -> 'c'
    'É' -> 'C'
    'č' -> 'c'
    'ü' -> 'u'
     and etc.
